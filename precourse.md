#### Pre-course materials
The course will be taught using different programming languages depending on the tools available. 
We will be using conda environments for each session to ensure reproducibility. 
Please refer to the installation instructions [here][1]). 

If you would like to get started in one of the programming languages 
have a look at the bonus material in the [Reading Materials page][2].
