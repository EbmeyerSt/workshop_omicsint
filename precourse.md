We will be using conda environments for each session to ensure reproducibility. Follow the installation instructions [here][1].

The course will be taught using both R and Python depending on the tools available. While you will be able to follow all lectures
and exercises conceptually, it is easier if you get acquainted with programming in both languages:  
- [Quick introduction to R][2]
- [Quick introduction to Python][3]
