# Pre-course materials

We advise you to have a look at the following materials prior to the course. 
While none of them are essential in order to be able to follow the classes, it is advisable if you can 
go through them beforehand.


1) Feature selection https://towardsdatascience.com/select-features-for-omics-integration-511390b7e7fd

2) Dimensionality reduction https://towardsdatascience.com/reduce-dimensions-for-single-cell-4224778a2d67

3) Supervised Omics integration https://towardsdatascience.com/supervised-omics-integration-2158e1a6d23f

4) Unsupervised Omics integration https://medium.com/@nikolay.oskolkov/unsupervised-omics-integration-688bf8fa49bf



# Software

The course will be taught using different programming languages depending on the required tools. We suggest you to install the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter
- R 3.5 or higher
- R Studio (preferably version 1.2)
- Cytoscape

You do not need to know how to program in both R or Python to follow the lessons, as we will demonstrate how to perform the analyses. All the materials 
will be openly available after the course, so you will be able to run them on your own.

We also provide a conda environment that contains part of the software and packages that we will use. This has not been fully tested in all operating systems. 
You can find instructions [here][6].

# Bonus

**Programming in R and Python**
If you would like to get started in one of the programming languages that we use, we regularly offer courses in [R and Python][1]. For instance:
- [Python programming with applications to bioinformatics][2] - Introductory Python course

You may also look at the following online materials:
- [RaukR 2019][3] - a comprehensive R course. New edition (Summer 2020) to be announced soon
- [Data Analysis and Visualization in Python][4] - an introductory course for Python
- [Intro to R and RStudio for Genomics][5]
