# Omics Integration and Systems Biology 
**Stockholm 2019-09-09 to 2019-09-12**

**Address SciLifeLab, Tomtebodavagen 23A, 171 65 Solna**

National course open for PhD students, postdocs, researchers and other employees inneed of multi-omics integration and introductory systems biology skills within all Swedish universities.

The aim of this workshop is to provide a fundamental integrated analysis of 1) biologicalnetwork construction and integration and 2) how modelling and multi-omics integrationmay be used to generate hypotheses and gain novel comprehensive biological insight.A general description of dierent methods for analysing dierent omics data (e.g. tran-scriptomics and genomics) will be presented with some of the lectures discussing several integration, clustering, and machine learning tools including supervised and unsupervised methods. 
The various techniques are discussed in terms of their rationale and applicability, with a particular focus on possible confounding factors. Attendants will further gethands-on experience with analysis of processed high throughput data using modelling,biological network and topology analysis, and supervised/unsupervised methods.While basic understanding of NGS techniques is desirable it is not essential to fully followthe course. Further details about the course content will be indicated soon. 

***Further details about the course, as well as a course syllabus, will be indicated soon***
