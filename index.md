#### Omics Integration and Systems Biology
5 - 9 October 2020
Lund University, Department of Biology

***Notice: the April edition of our course has been cancelled due to the ongoing Coronavirus issues. The next edition of the course will take place in Lund in October.***

[Course application][1] is open. Deadline for registration: 21/08/2020


***Overview***

Course open for PhD students, postdocs, and researchers looking for an introduction to multi-omics integration and systems biology.

The aim of this workshop is to provide an integrated view of biological network construction and integration, constraint-based modelling, multi-omics integration through Machine Learning, and data-driven hypothesis generation.  A general description of different methods for analysing different omics data (e.g. transcriptomics and genomics) will be presented with some of the lectures discussing key methods in their integration. The techniques will be discussed in terms of their rationale and applicability, with a particular focus on possible confounding factors. The course will also include hands-on sessions and invited speaker seminars.

Some of the covered topics include:  

- Data wrangling in omics studies;
- Condition-specific and personalized modeling through Genome-scale Metabolic models based on integration of transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data;  
- Biological network inference, community and topology analysis and visualization
- Identification of key biological functions and pathways;  
- Identification of potential biomarkers and targetable genes through modeling and biological network analysis; 
- Application of key machine learning methods for multi-omics analysis including deep learning;  
- Multi-omics integration, clustering and dimensionality reduction;
- Similarity network fusion and Recommender systems;
- Integrated data visualization techniques

***Learning objectives***  
At the end of the course, students should:  
- Be able to integrate different omics and simulate biological functions using constraint-based models and [FBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_balance_analysis).
- Build biological networks based on different omics data, as well as integrated multi-omics networks;
- Use different biological network analysis techniques to compare different cell-types or conditions (e.g. disease vs healthy);
- Identify key methods for analysis and integration of omics data based on a given dataset;
- Understand strengths and pitfalls of key machine learning techniques in multi-omic analysis;
- Be aware of important confounding factors and sources of bias.


***Course fee***  
A course fee of 2000SEK will be invoiced to accepted participants. This includes lunches, coffee breaks, and a course dinner. Please note that NBIS cannot invoice individuals.
