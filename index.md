# Omics Integration and Systems Biology
9 - 12 September 2019, SciLifeLab, Tomtebodavagen 23A, 171 65 Stocholm

**<span style="color:blue">Attention! Any information in this website is subject to change.</span>**

Course open for PhD students, postdocs, and researchers looking for an introduction to multi-omics integration and systems biology.

The aim of this workshop is to provide an integrated view of biological network construction and integration, constraint-based modelling, multi-omics integration and hypothesis generation. 

A general description of dierent methods for analysing dierent omics data (e.g. transcriptomics and genomics) will be presented with some of the lectures discussing several integration, clustering, and machine learning tools including supervised and unsupervised methods. 
The various techniques are discussed in terms of their rationale and applicability, with a particular focus on possible confounding factors. Attendants will further gethands-on experience with analysis of processed high throughput data using modelling,biological network and topology analysis, and supervised/unsupervised methods.While basic understanding of NGS techniques is desirable it is not essential to fully followthe course. Further details about the course content will be indicated soon.
