#### Course syllabus

This course will be divided in 4 main themes:

**1. Data Management** - Important considerations about efficient and proper data management when running multiomic analyses.

**2. Constraint-based modeling** - How transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data may be integrated with genome-scale metabolic models to generate context-specific or persontalized models. Basic concepts about flux balance analysis and metabolic modeling will be provided. Identification of key metabolites, metabolic genes and pathways, including potential biomarkers and targetable genes will be discussed.  

**3. Topology analysis** - How using information derived from genome-scale metabolic models, co-expression networks, and other biological networks may be used to identify central genes, metabolites or proteins, and their characterization.  

**4. Omics integration** - How different omics may be integrated, their clustering, dimensionality reduction and other key concepts for their analysis using both supervised and unsupervised methods.
