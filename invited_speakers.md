Head of Data Science & Bioinformatics at AstraZeneca

**Talk Title:** *Deriving actionable insight from omics data – an industry perspective* 

**Time:** October 15, 10:00 – 11:15 CET onsite and online on zoom

**Link to Talk:** [BIG talk event](https://www.scilifelab.se/event/deriving-actionable-insight-from-omics-data-an-industry-perspective/), [Link](https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/8783305765?omn=66805936374), pass:spd996

**Description of the Talk:**  
This talk will focus on how advancement in omic analysis is enabling the realisation of precision medicine in chronic complex diseases. Large, well phenotyped cohorts highlights the heterogeneity of disease and through single cell technologies we are able to study disease processes at unprecedented granularity, but how do we take these insights into actionable and deployable applications? Here I will focus on how we employ a breadth of bioinformatic techniques of different modalities to bridge between populations, patients, and cellular level to identify novel targets, biomarkers and patient populations.

**About the Speaker:**  
Daniel’s team is working with applied bioinformatics across the whole drug discovery and development pipeline, from target identification to indication expansion and exploratory biomarker analysis in clinical trials.

Postdoctoral Fellow, Broad institute, USA

**Talk Title:** *Generation of context-specific genome-scale metabolic models using single-cell RNA-Seq data*  

**Time:** October 17, 13:00 – 14:15 CET online on zoom

**Link to Talk:** [BIG talk event](https://www.scilifelab.se/event/oimcs-integration-and-systems-biology/), [Link](https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/8783305765?omn=67312957385), pass:spd996

**Description of the Talk:**  
The metabolic networks in cells vary across tissues and cell types, and to accurately model the metabolism of cells, the full generic metabolic network defined in the genome needs to be reduced to a context-specific network representing the network expressed specifically in the cells of interest. Single-cell RNA-Seq promises to provide the information needed for such a reduction, but noise in the form of data sparsity is a challenge. Here, we present methods to handle data sparsity and estimate the uncertainty of modeling results.

**About the Speaker:**  
Johan is an expert in modeling cancer metabolism and analyzing single-cell RNA/DNA sequencing data, aiming to uncover vulnerabilities in cancer. With a background in both computer science and biochemistry, Johan has completed a PhD in metabolic modeling at Chalmers University of Technology and now works as a postdoc in the Getz lab at the Broad Institute, focusing on CLL/Richter's syndrome and hypoxia in solid tumors.

<br>
Professor of Biochemistry at Stockholm University, Head of In Situ Sequencing unit Spatial Biology platform Scilife Lab

**Talk Title:** *Targeted in situ sequencing for characterization of the genetic, molecular and cellular diversity of healthy and disease tissues*

**Time:** October 18, 10:00 – 11:00 CET online, only for course participants

**Link to Talk:** [Link](https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/8783305765?omn=62152485378)

**Description of the Talk:**  
This talk will cover the application of our in house in situ sequencing chemistry, and the Xenium version from 10 x Genomics, for studies of various tissues from healthy and disease organs from various species. It will cover how this spatially resolved transcriptomic data can be used to integrate other omics data set (bulk and sc expression, DNA sequence variation, protein staining, other spatial transcriptomic data sets, etc.), and how this helps the interpretation of both the other omics data sets, and the targeted in situ transcriptomic data.

**About the Speaker:**  
Our work is focused on development of novel molecular analysis concept for use in research and diagnostics, with primary focus on infectious and cancer diagnostics. We address development of both fundamental assay architecture and novel devices. Our research is based on a cross-disciplinary approach involving extensive collaboration with scientist ranging from physics and engineering to biomedical and clinical research, and with the ultimate goal of translating the research into industrial products to make the technologies available for the scientific community and hospital labs.
