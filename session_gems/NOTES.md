# Learning objectives:

## Quick start
* Load a model and simulate it
* Obtain a model from a database for a host organism you're interested in

## Basics
* Understand the basic data structures of models
* Learn how to query models
* Setting objectives and optimizing models
* Manipulating flux bounds for defining media conditions and knocking out reactions
* Importing models from different file formats

## Model reconstruction
* ModelSEED
* Defining reactions and adding pathways to models (add some pathway to e_coli_core)

## Pathway visualizations with Escher
* Visualizing data in escher
* Importing a model into escher and drawing a pathway map


## Simple analysis tasks
* Determine gene essentiality
* Flux variablity analysis
* Phenotyptic phase plane

## Omics data analysis
* Fluxomics
* Metabolomics

## Strain design algorithms
* Production envelope (fluxes, yields, c-mol yields)
* Knock-out strategies, growth-coupled designs
* Algorithms for computing knock-out strategies
* Comparing flux ranges of WT and production strain
* Differential FVA
* Swapping co-factors in a reaction
* Using OptSwap to find optimal co-factors to swap
