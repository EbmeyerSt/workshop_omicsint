If we are only interested in the flux value of a single reaction or the objective, it is faster to instead use `model.slim_optimize` which only does the optimization and returns the objective value leaving it up to you to fetch other values that you may need. For example, let's optimize and get the flux value of the `ATPM` reaction."
