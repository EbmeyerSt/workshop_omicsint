# Edit course content

## File hierarchy

You can basically invent your own structure for the course but a good template
is the following:


    _config.yml
    index.md
    labs/
         lab1.md
    lectures/
         lecture1.md
         lecture2.pdf


* File hierarchy of stuff
* Edit the menu structure in config.yml 
* Edit files
    * Features available
    * Which `<code>` tags to use.
