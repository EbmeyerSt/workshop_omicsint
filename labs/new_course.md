# New course


There are three steps to bootstrapping a new course:

1. Create a new repo on github
2. Add the base template for a course
3. Enable github-pages on github



## Step 1. Create a repo on github

To setup a completely new course, start by adding a new repository on github.
Go to [repository creation page](https://github.com/organizations/NBISweden/repositories/new)

Please use a name that starts with `course-` for example: `course-proteomics`,
make it public and do not initialize the repository with a README.


## Step 2. Add base template

## Step 3. Enable GitHub Pages

Go to the settings on github for your newly created repo to enable GitHub
Pages. Almost at the bottom of that page there is a section devoted to GitHub
Pages, the source should be `master branch`, ignore all other settings.
