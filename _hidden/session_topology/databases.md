#### Databases

The resources below present several well-known databases for [PPIs](#ppis), [Gene Regulatory Networks](#gene-regulatory-networks), [Metabolic](#metabolic) and [mixed interactions](#mixed). This is far from being an exaustive list.



##### PPIs
- [Database of Interacting Proteins][https://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/Main.cgi]
- [EBI Intact database](http://string-db.org/)
- [Human protein reference database](http://www.hprd.org/)
- [Human protein interaction database](http://wilab.inha.ac.kr/hpid/webforms/intro.aspx)
- [Human reference interactome](http://interactome.baderlab.org/)
- [String](https://string-db.org/cgi/input.pl) 

##### Metabolic
- [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/)
