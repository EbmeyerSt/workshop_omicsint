Some comments:
- I've discussed with Mihail Anton (NBIS) and Jonathan (lead author in the latest metabolic atlas paper). 
I told them that the idea to show the metabolic atlas came from the visualization part of the workshop. 

It is suggested to show to the students:
- Map browser
- Gene integration from Protein Atlas, cell types etc.
- Interaction partners (will be useful given the topology and integrated network analysis on the next day)
- GEM browser: for GEM deposit
- etc.

In an upcoming release, before our course, they are preparing a version where the user can upload a sample and
use it to map how their gene expression looks in the browser.

They are available to join us in presenting about the metabolic atlas if it is worth it. I told them that this
part should take roughly 30 mins to present to the students. This is something we have to discuss as it depends on the
logistics.
