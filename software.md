#### Software
The course will be taught using different programming languages depending on the tools available. You'll need to run
different software, which is much easier if you use a conda environment (further instructions [here][6]). For each session, use
the following:

- [env-machine-learning.yml][1]
- [env-networks.yml][2] (for Unix/OSX), and [env-networks.yml][4]
- [env-modeling.yml][3]


If you prefer manual installation, we suggest the installation of the following:

- [Python 3.7][41] or higher
- [R 3.5][44] or higher
- [R Studio][43] (preferably version 1.2 or higher)
- [Cytoscape][45] 3.7.1
- [Jupyter][42] (recommended)

If you have not used python, a good option is to install [Conda][7].

You do not need to know how to program in both R or Python to follow the lessons. If you would like to get started in one of the programming languages 
have a look at the bonus material in the [Reading Materials page](reading_materials.md).
